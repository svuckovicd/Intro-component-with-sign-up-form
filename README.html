<h2 id="welcome-">Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a> challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.</p>
<p><strong>To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Your challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
<p>You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you&#39;ve got something you&#39;d like to practice, feel free to give it a go.</p>
<p>Your users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device&#39;s screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
<li>Receive an error message when the <code>form</code> is submitted if:<ul>
<li>Any <code>input</code> field is empty. The message for this error should say <em>&quot;[Field Name] cannot be empty&quot;</em></li>
<li>The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: <a href="mailto:`name@host.tld">`name@host.tld</a>`). The message for this error should say <em>&quot;Looks like this is not an email&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="where-to-find-everything">Where to find everything</h2>
<p>Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the <code>/design</code> folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. </p>
<p>The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you&#39;ll need to use your best judgment for styles such as <code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.</p>
<p>If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to <a href="">purchase here</a>.</p>
<p>You will find all the required assets in the <code>/images</code> folder. The assets are already optimized.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>style-guide.md</code> file, which contains the information you&#39;ll need, such as color palette and fonts.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-project">Building your project</h2>
<p>Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize your project as a public repository on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you&#39;re not sure how to do this, <a href="https://try.github.io/">have a read through of this Try Git resource</a>.</li>
<li>Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using <a href="http://bit.ly/fem-zeit">ZEIT Now</a>. We&#39;ve got more information about deploying your project with ZEIT below.</li>
<li>Look through the designs to start planning out how you&#39;ll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.</li>
<li>Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.</li>
<li>Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-size</code>.</li>
<li>Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you&#39;re happy you&#39;ve completed the area you&#39;re working on.</li>
<li>If you&#39;d like to try making your project fully responsive, we&#39;d recommend checking out <a href="http://bit.ly/fem-sizzy">Sizzy</a>. It&#39;s a great browser that makes it easy to view your site across multiple devices.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deploying-your-project">Deploying your project</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using <a href="http://bit.ly/fem-zeit">ZEIT Now</a> as it&#39;s an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you&#39;d like to use ZEIT, here are some steps to follow to get started:</p>
